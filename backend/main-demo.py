# Demo content for testing
DEMO_TRANSCRIPT = """
This is a demo transcript from a training session. Today we had some great wins with the team - Preston Location increased their baseline from 30 to 32 patients, which is a 20% increase since starting. The Raleigh location also added new front desk team members including Rachel, who has HR management experience.

For goals and statistics, Preston has a baseline of 32 with a goal of 35 new patients. Incentives are in place, and Dr. Kashyap provides an extra $100 incentive for first-time certifications at the Raleigh location.

The biggest barrier we're facing is that Craig, the office manager, wasn't as engaged as hoped. He was splitting time between Doug's PP training and this 5-Star training. We didn't get proper commitments at the end because he wasn't present for the wrap-up.

For human capital, they have enough team members to handle current capacity. Marketing is managed by Paola, and they recently had a successful Invisalign open house with 21 out of 21 patients attending and starting treatment.

Space-wise, Raleigh has 5 operatories but needs renovation and more space. They're looking to purchase the building to add 20+ operatories. Preston has 7 operatories with adequate space.

Financially, everything appears to be in order with no apparent barriers. Their renewal date is at the end of the year, and we're planning trainings into Q1 of 2026.

For hotels in the area, I don't recommend the Townplace as it's quite run down. The area has good restaurants and the training location is easily accessible.
